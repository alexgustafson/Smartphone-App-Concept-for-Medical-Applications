### Dermatology Apps

Mobile apps are an especially good fit for Dermatology-related care. Most dermatological conditions are by nature visible. The initial diagnosis and follow up monitoring is mostly done visually. A mobile device with a camera can aid patients and practitioners in the diagnosis of a dermatological condition and tracking it's development. The article Mobile Applications in Dermatology\cite{Brewer_2013} in 2013 identified 229 dermatology-related apps across 5 app platforms ( Android, Apple, Blackberry, Nokia, and Windows ). These were grouped into categories based on their primary functionality. By far the most popular category were apps in the "Reference" category. The second most popular category on the Android and Apple stores were "Self-surveillance/diagnosis" apps.
