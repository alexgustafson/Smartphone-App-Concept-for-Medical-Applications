Neither Google nor Apple provide an open API which would make it easy to gather and analyse data regarding the availabel Apps. It is possible to search for "Medical" apps in either store through simple web interfaces, but the "Medical" category is so wide that further subcategories are necessary. Unfortunately queries are limited to lists of the Top 100 popular free or paid apps.
