It is important to note that the categories listed above are not defined in the stores. The apps must be manually assigned to a category based on an interpretation of the description text in the store and information obtainable on related websites. It is possible therefore that apps that were originally designated to the "Reference" category might have been interpreted in this paper as a "Educational aid" app for example.
