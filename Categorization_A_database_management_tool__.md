## Categorization

The term "Medical App" is very broad and neither the iTunes nor Goole app stores offer any kind of sub categorization. In order to get a better overview of what sort of Medical Apps are available it was necessary to manually browse the gathered data and assign categories to the apps.

A database management tool was created using the python based Django Web Framework. Django provides many tools that makes constructing and interacting with databases very easy. The built-in backend administration tool can be configured to browse, edit, and filter data.
